This repo showcases the GitHub visualation project which accesses the GitHub API and then graphs the data of a user/repo
The main part of the webpage showcases basic user info such as their account creation date, name, business and location.
The other part of the visualization uses JavaScript libraries to show the user commits in a line chart and pie chart. The next part showcases the frequency of these commits. This can be used to see how often the user commits but also what part of the day they are most active at.
